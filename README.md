# Cloud-coverage-prediction

## Cloud coverage can cast over the solar farms in a few minutes and significantly bring down the power production. In this level, we try to innovatively predict the percentage of total cloud coverage for the next upcoming intervals using the available weather and sky camera data. 

### Predicting cloud cover in a short time span of 120 minutes is very challenging. On this time
scale, changes in local cloud cover are driven by a combination of dynamical and
physical parameters such as wind speed, wind direction sea-level pressure, humidity and
temperature over the asset of our interest. Short interval cloud cover prediction requires
accurate estimates of cloud motion and presence using weather data and sky camera
images or physics-based weather models, or a combination of both. In this level, you are
expected to predict the total cloud coverage as a percentage of the open sky for a fixed
field of view at 4 horizon intervals of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes from a 6-hour window
of historical data.

** we are provided with the following data:

Train set:

1) 1-year raw sky camera images [3] at 10 - minute frequency
2) 1-year local weather data [3] at 1- minute frequency

Test set:

You will be provided with 300 sets of test data, distributed over a year . The test set
will have the same format as the training data. Each test set consists of the following:
1) A set of images from the same camera at a 10-minute frequency, covering a time
span of 6 hours.
2) Weather information at 1-minute frequency, covering the same 6-hour window
